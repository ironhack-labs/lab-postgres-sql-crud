)
VALUES
('solid', 'solidjs', 'A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.', 10700, 'solidjs.com', 194, 'MIT License', 624, 73, 'typescript', 'UI Library', '2011-08-13'),

select * from jslibraries
order by release_date asc
limit 1;

<br>

**3. Get all the fields of the library that was released most recently (last).**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
select * from jslibraries
order by release_date desc
limit 1;
<br>

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
select * from jslibraries
where release_date< '2015-01-01';
<br>

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
select name, release_date from jslibraries
where licence is null;

select name, type from jslibraries where contributors > 1000;
<br>

**9. Get the total number of `stars` of all the libraries.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
select sum(stars) as total_stars from jslibraries;
<br>

**10. Get the average number of `contributors` for all the libraries.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
select avg(contributors) as avg_contributors from jslibraries; 
<br>

**11. Update the `licence` field of the libriaries without a licence to store `'unknown'` instead of `NULL`.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
update jslibraries
set licence = 'unknown'
where licence is null;
<br>

**12. Update the `used_by` field of the libraries that don't have it specified to store `0` ( i.e., number zero), instead of `NULL`.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
update jslibraries
set used_by = 0
where used_by is null;
<br>

**13. Update all the records to capitalize the string provided in the `main_technology` field.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
update jslibraries 
set main_technology = upper(main_technology);
<br>

**14. Delete all the records where `licence` is `'unknown'`.**

<!-- Your Query Goes Here -->
delete from jslibraries 
where licence = 'unknown';
<br>

**15. Delete all the records with 10000 or less `stars`.**
