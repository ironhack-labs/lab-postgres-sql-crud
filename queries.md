**1. Add the `solid` and `chartjs` libraries as new rows to the `jslibraries` table.**

INSERT INTO jslibraries(name, owner, description, stars, url, releases, licence, used_by, contributors, main_technology, type,release_date)
VALUES
(
'solid',
'solidjs',
'A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.',
10700,
'solidjs.com',

**2. Get all the fields of the library that was released earliest (first).**

select \* from jslibraries
order by release_date
limit 1;

<br>

**3. Get all the fields of the library that was released most recently (last).**

select \* from jslibraries
order by release_date desc
limit 1;

<br>

**4. All the libraries released before 2015.**

select \* from jslibraries
where (release_date) < '2015-01-01';

<br>

**5. Get the `name` and the `release_date` of the libraries without a licence.**

select name, release_date from jslibraries
where licence is null;

<br>

**6. Get the `name` and the `stars` from all CSS Framework libraries.**

select name, stars from jslibraries
where type = 'CSS Framework';

<br>

**7. Get the `name` of the libraries where the main technology is Typescript.**

select name from jslibraries
where main_technology = 'typescript'

<br>

**8. Get the `name` and the `type` of all the libraries with more than 1000 contributors.**

select name, type from jslibraries
where contributors > 1000;

<br>

**9. Get the total number of `stars` of all the libraries.**

select sum(stars) from jslibraries

<br>

**10. Get the average number of `contributors` for all the libraries.**

select avg(contributors) from jslibraries
<br>

**11. Update the `licence` field of the libriaries without a licence to store `'unknown'` instead of `NULL`.**

update jslibraries
set licence = 'unknown'
where licence is null;

<br>

**12. Update the `used_by` field of the libraries that don't have it specified to store `0` ( i.e., number zero), instead of `NULL`.**

update jslibraries
set used_by = 'unknown'
where used_by is null;

<br>

**13. Update all the records to capitalize the string provided in the `main_technology` field.**

update jslibraries
set main_technology = initcap(main_technology);

<br>

**14. Delete all the records where `licence` is `'unknown'`.**

delete from jslibraries
where licence = 'unknown';

<br>

**15. Delete all the records with 10000 or less `stars`.**

delete from jslibraries
where stars <= 10000;

<br>

**16. Delete all the records with less than 100 `releases`.**

delete from jslibraries
where releases < 100;
